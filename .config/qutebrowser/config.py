# Which cookies to accept. With QtWebEngine, this setting also controls
# other features with tracking capabilities similar to those of cookies;
# including IndexedDB, DOM storage, filesystem API, service workers, and
# AppCache. Note that with QtWebKit, only `all` and `never` are
# supported as per-domain values. Setting `no-3rdparty` or `no-
# unknown-3rdparty` per-domain on QtWebKit will have the same effect as
# `all`. If this setting is used with URL patterns, the pattern gets
# applied to the origin/first party URL of the page making the request,
# not the request URL. With QtWebEngine 5.15.0+, paths will be stripped
# from URLs, so URL patterns using paths will not match. With
# QtWebEngine 5.15.2+, subdomains are additionally stripped as well, so
# you will typically need to set this setting for `example.com` when the
# cookie is set on `somesubdomain.example.com` for it to work properly.
# To debug issues with this setting, start qutebrowser with `--debug
# --logfilter network --debug-flag log-cookies` which will show all
# cookies being set.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - all: Accept all cookies.
#   - no-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only. This is known to break some sites, such as GMail.
#   - no-unknown-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only, unless a cookie is already set for the domain. On QtWebEngine, this is the same as no-3rdparty.
#   - never: Don't accept cookies at all.

# the full referer. No restart is needed with QtWebKit.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - always: Always send the Referer.
#   - never: Never send the Referer. This is not recommended, as some sites may break.
#   - same-domain: Only send the Referer for the same domain. This will still protect your privacy, but shouldn't break any sites. With QtWebEngine, the referer will still be sent for other domains, but with stripped path information.

# QtWebEngine. * `{upstream_browser_version}`: The corresponding
# Safari/Chrome version. * `{qutebrowser_version}`: The currently
# running qutebrowser version.  The default value is equal to the
# unchanged user agent of QtWebKit/QtWebEngine.  Note that the value

# `{aligned_index}`: Index of this tab padded with spaces to have the
# same   width. * `{relative_index}`: Index of this tab relative to the
# current tab. * `{id}`: Internal tab ID of this tab. * `{scroll_pos}`:
# Page scroll position. * `{host}`: Host of the current web page. *
# `{backend}`: Either `webkit` or `webengine` * `{private}`: Indicates
# when private mode is enabled. * `{current_url}`: URL of the current

# placeholder. The placeholder will be replaced by the search term, use
# `{{` and `}}` for literal `{`/`}` braces.  The following further
# placeholds are defined to configure how special characters in the
# search terms are replaced by safe characters (called 'quoting'):  *
# `{}` and `{semiquoted}` quote everything except slashes; this is the
# most   sensible choice for almost all search engines (for the search
# term   `slash/and&amp` this placeholder expands to `slash/and%26amp`).
# * `{quoted}` quotes all characters (for `slash/and&amp` this
# placeholder   expands to `slash%2Fand%26amp`). * `{unquoted}` quotes
# nothing (for `slash/and&amp` this placeholder   expands to
# `slash/and&amp`). * `{0}` means the same as `{}`, but can be used
# multiple times.  The search engine named `DEFAULT` is used when
# `url.auto_search` is turned on and something else than a URL was
# entered to be opened. Other search engines can be used by prepending
# the search engine name to the search term, e.g. `:open google
# qutebrowser`.
